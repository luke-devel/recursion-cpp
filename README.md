## Write a C++ program that does the following :

> 1. Accepts array size from the keyboard. The size must be positive integer that is > = 5 - *Done*

> 2. Use the size from step 1 in order to create an integer array. Populate the created array  with random integer values between 10 and 375. - *Done* 

> 3. Display the generated array. - *Done*

> 4. Write a function that uses recursion in order to display the array in reverse order - *Done*

> 5. Write a function that uses recursion in order to display squares of integers in
> ascending order, starting from 1 to first number in the array. - *Done* 

> 6. Write a recursive function that takes that integer n and returns the sum of the digits
> of that integer - *Done? vague instructions*

> 7. Write a function that uses recursion in order to determine whether or not every
> number in the array is a prime number . - *Done*
